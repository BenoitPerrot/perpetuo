/**
  * A target name (expressing where to deploy to) can cover more precise targets (e.g. the
  * European Union as a location includes all its member states, each of which may or may
  * not make sense as a target for a deployment); a more complex target expression can also
  * be used to express where to deploy to (i.e. deploy here but not there).
  * Resolving a target consists in computing the list of all the underlying targets covered
  * by an expression (which can be as simple as a name).
  * An atomic target is a target that cannot be resolved to smaller parts of itself because
  * FOR THE GIVEN PRODUCT, it will NEVER be possible to deploy to a subset of that target.
  * If the user can choose among "France", "Paris" and "Lyon" for a target and nothing else,
  * then "Paris" and "Lyon" ARE atoms, and "France" IS NOT. "Paris" and "Lyon" both have the
  * tag "France".
  * An atom in a user input is resolved to itself.
  * A tag in a user input is resolved to the union of all the atoms that have that tag, so
  * "France" is resolved as "Paris âˆª Lyon".
  *
  * In order to support MORE than combinations of atoms in the incoming target expressions,
  * e.g. tags, at least one of the following methods must be overridden:
  * - `getAllAtomsAndTags` to get the entire `TargetGrammar` supported out of the box
  * - `resolveNonAtoms` to provide a custom resolver, possibly allowing a custom grammar
